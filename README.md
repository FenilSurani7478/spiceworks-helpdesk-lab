# spiceworks-helpdesk-lab
Hands-on Spiceworks Help Desk lab: installed and configured Spiceworks, created users/roles, built ticket categories &amp; SLAs, tested email alerts, worked tickets end-to-end (intake→triage→resolution), documented workflows, KB articles, and basic reporting. Includes screenshots and step-by-step notes. Great for entry-level IT support practice. @home!
